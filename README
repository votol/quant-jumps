1. First stage. There wil be a class which make calculation using hemiltonian in form of sum of matrix in COO format 
with time-dependent coefficients. All other operators must have the same form (such as operator of conection with the bath,
or operators average of which we want to calculate). Also there will be a class containing device-dependened function - abstract class
, and a child - test class for cuda.
